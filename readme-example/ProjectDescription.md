### Purpose

This map serves as the first draft of a "base map" for my MA thesis at the University of Kentucky. For my thesis, I am interested in mobility differentials in Atlanta, Georgia. Mobility differentials simply refer to empirical observation that different groups of people move differently, however, a critical position on these differentials reveals that movement is not an independent phenomenon. Urban mobility potentials are extremely inequitable with low-income and racialized communities often facing the worst outcomes both in material realities and in affective community conditions. My thesis attempts to both capture these material realities and more affective conditions through quantitative, qualitative, and geovisual methods. The first step in completing this project is creating a qualitative "base map" on top of which I will plot qualitative/affective experiences of mobility based on the responses of my research participants (interviews scheduled for July 2024).

### Mapmaking Process

Example of in process map ![in process image](filepath)

You can describe the mapmapking process in this section, including images where it helps to describe the process.

You can also use some lists, and here's some formatting ideas.

1. **Example bold**
2. *Example italics*
3. 
4.
