### Data Source

* [Atlanta Regional Open Data Portal](https://opendata.atlantaregional.com/)
* [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php)
* [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/explore-maps)

* Initial Data projection: NAD 83 (ESPG: 4269)
* Final Map projection: Mercator (ESPG: 3857)

### Project Background

This map serves as the first draft of a "base map" for my MA thesis at the University of Kentucky. For my thesis, I am interested in mobility differentials in Atlanta, Georgia. Mobility differentials simply refer to empirical observation that different groups of people move differently, however, a critical position on these differentials reveals that movement is not an independent phenomenon. Urban mobility potentials are extremely inequitable with low-income and racialized communities often facing the worst outcomes both in material realities and in affective community conditions. My thesis attempts to both capture these material realities and more affective conditions through quantitative, qualitative, and geovisual methods.

### Purpose

The first step towards building my MA project is creating a qualitative "base map" on top of which I will plot qualitative/affective experiences of mobility based on the responses of my research participants (interviews scheduled for July 2024). This map finished product serves as the first draft of my MA project. Currently, the map is meant to help build my quantative understanding of mobility in Atlanta before I conduct analysis in May. I plan to slowly add additional layers that represent transit accessability, car ownership, sociodemographic markers and more. As I develop my programing skills I wish to use Javascript to build in user interactivity that allows a self-guided understanding of inequitable mobility in Atlanta. Future expansions I am most excited about include sound and video intergration!

### Mapmaking Process



You can also use some lists, and here's some formatting ideas.

1. Modified baselayers from **Grey's Arch Assignment (3.4)** to fit darker design; push into the background
2. Sourced data from *open* data sources
3. Prepared demographic data (sourced from **Social Explorer**) for GIS format in QGIS
 ![Data Prep and Label Extraction in QGIS for later use in Mapbox](C:/Users/spark/OneDrive/Documents/00_NMP/MAP671/Map-671-FinalProject-lalusz/Process1.JPG)
4. Styled all layers and labels in **Mapbox Studio**

### Map summary

What are the key findings to take from your map and the overall mapmaking process?

This map actually displaces the blockgroups for all of Fulton and Dekalb counties (the counties that city limits cross), so we see an interesting, and expected, racial clustering throughout both Atlanta and the counties. We see a clustering of Marta Routes along the city limit, where we see the south-western boarder between majority White and Non-white block groups. My make take away from this map and process is that race and mobility are linked in Atlanta (visible just by looking at public transit data and demographic data alone).

This takeaway prompts me to consider an additional quantative measurement to factor into my analysis:transit route temporalities. We see expanisve transit coverage in non-white block groups, but how useable (usability as a factor between converage and run time) are those options for residents? 
Additionally we see key areas (especially towards more suburban North-Fulton and Dekalb Counties), we see major roads start to serve as major boundaries between white and non-white block groups: giving potential case sites for the historical analysis section of my thesis.
